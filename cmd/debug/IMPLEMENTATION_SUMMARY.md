# Implementation Summary: Step 8 - Persist Player & Chunk Updates

## Task Completed ✅

**Task**: Ensure after every ProcessHarvestTick we call the correct save/persist hooks (player.Manager.Save, chunk.Manager.Save) if the debug environment requires explicit persistence.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Save Methods to Managers

**File**: `/internal/chunk/manager.go`
- Added `Save(ctx context.Context) error` method
- Handles database synchronization and cache cleanup
- Ensures all chunk-related transactions are committed

**File**: `/internal/player/manager.go`
- Added `Save(ctx context.Context) error` method
- Handles database synchronization for player data
- Ensures all player-related transactions are committed

### 2. Enhanced Debug Tool Structure

**File**: `/cmd/debug/main.go`
- Added player manager creation
- Updated app initialization to include both managers
- Added import for player package

**File**: `/cmd/debug/models/app.go`
- Added player manager field to App struct
- Updated constructor to accept player manager
- Pass player manager to chunk explorer

### 3. Enhanced Chunk Explorer Model

**File**: `/cmd/debug/models/chunk_explorer.go`
- Added player manager field to ChunkExplorerModel struct
- Updated constructor to accept player manager
- Enhanced ProcessHarvestTick to call persistence hooks
- Added environment variable checking logic
- Added persistence helper methods

### 4. Key Implementation Details

#### Environment Variable Support
- `DEBUG_PERSIST=true` or `DEBUG_PERSIST=1` - Explicit persistence flag
- `DEBUG=true` or `DEBUG=1` - General debug flag that enables persistence

#### Persistence Flow
1. `ProcessHarvestTick()` performs normal harvest logic
2. Calls `persistHarvestUpdates()` which checks environment variables
3. If persistence required:
   - Calls `persistChunkUpdates()` → `chunkManager.Save(ctx)`
   - Calls `persistPlayerUpdates()` → `playerManager.Save(ctx)`
4. Errors are logged but don't fail the harvest operation

#### New Methods Added
- `shouldPersistInDebug()` - Checks environment variables
- `persistHarvestUpdates()` - Orchestrates persistence
- `persistChunkUpdates()` - Calls chunk manager Save
- `persistPlayerUpdates()` - Calls player manager Save
- `SetHarvesting()` - Testing helper
- `GetHarvestMsg()` - Testing helper

### 5. Testing & Validation

- Code compiles successfully
- Environment variable logic tested
- Persistence hooks properly integrated
- Error handling implemented
- Full logging for debugging

## Usage

```bash
# Enable persistence in debug mode
DEBUG_PERSIST=true ./debug -view=chunks

# Or use general debug flag
DEBUG=1 ./debug -view=chunks

# Normal operation (no persistence)
./debug -view=chunks
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. ✅ **Explicit Persistence Control**: Debug environment can control when persistence occurs
2. ✅ **Proper Integration**: Uses actual manager Save() methods, not stubs
3. ✅ **Environment Awareness**: Respects debug environment requirements
4. ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of persistence failures
5. ✅ **Performance**: Only activates when explicitly requested
6. ✅ **Logging**: Full visibility into persistence operations

## Production Impact

- **Zero Impact**: Feature only activates in debug environment with specific flags
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality unchanged
- **Safe**: Persistence failures don't break harvest operations
- **Controlled**: Only runs when explicitly requested via environment variables

The implementation fully satisfies the requirement to "ensure after every ProcessHarvestTick we call the correct save/persist hooks (player.Manager.Save, chunk.Manager.Save) if the debug environment requires explicit persistence."
