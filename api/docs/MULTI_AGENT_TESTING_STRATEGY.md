# Multi-Agent Expert Testing Strategy

## Three-Stage Approach Using Specialized Agents

### Stage 1: Codebase Analysis 
**Agent: @agent-go-testing-expert**
- Analyze entire VoidMesh API codebase for testing anti-patterns
- Identify dependency injection issues and hard-to-test code
- Find missing interfaces, tight coupling, and testability problems
- Generate comprehensive report with specific recommendations
- Prioritize fixes needed for better test implementation

### Stage 2: Code Quality & Refactoring
**Agent: @agent-go-expert**
- Fix identified anti-patterns and code quality issues
- Implement missing interfaces for better dependency injection
- Improve code structure and patterns for easier testing
- Ensure consistent architecture across all services
- Apply Go best practices and optimization patterns

### Stage 3: Service Test Implementation (Delegated)
**Agent: @agent-go-testing-expert** (per service, in priority order)
1. **World Service Tests** - World creation, retrieval, validation
2. **Chunk Service Tests** - Generation, caching, terrain distribution  
3. **Inventory Service Tests** - Item management, constraints, harvesting
4. **Resource Node Service Tests** - Distribution, clustering, spawn logic
5. **Noise Generator Tests** - Deterministic generation, performance
6. **Terrain Service Tests** - Type definitions, movement costs

### Benefits:
- **Quality-First Approach**: Fix underlying issues before testing
- **Expert Specialization**: Each agent handles their domain expertise
- **Systematic Progression**: Methodical improvement then testing
- **Consistent Patterns**: Uniform testing approach across services
- **Unit Test Focus**: Defer integration tests as requested
- **Scalable Process**: Can parallelize service implementations

### Success Criteria:
- All service layer anti-patterns resolved
- Comprehensive unit tests for all 6 remaining services
- Consistent dependency injection and mocking patterns
- High test coverage and quality codebase foundation
- Block 2 (Service Layer) 100% complete

### Current Status:
- Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure (✅ Complete)
- Phase 2: Database Layer Tests (✅ Complete - 79.4% coverage)
- Phase 3: Character Service Tests (✅ Complete with dependency injection)
- **79 skipped tests** created across all pending services for visibility

### Services Pending Implementation:
- [ ] World Service (`services/world/world_test.go`)
- [ ] Chunk Service (`services/chunk/chunk_test.go`)
- [ ] Inventory Service (`services/inventory/inventory_test.go`)
- [ ] Resource Node Service (`services/resource_node/resource_node_test.go`)
- [ ] Terrain Service (`services/terrain/terrain_test.go`)
- [ ] Noise Generator (`services/noise/noise_test.go`)

### Next Action:
Start with **go-testing-expert** codebase analysis to identify improvement opportunities before implementing service tests.
