## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial implementation of VoidMesh API - a chunk-based resource harvesting system for API-only games

- **Features**: Chunk explorer, real-time node visualization, database inspection
- **Development**: Enhanced development experience with visual debugging

### Technical Notes
This is a **production-ready, fully functional** Go backend service that implements a sophisticated chunk-based resource harvesting system with comprehensive player management. The code is well-structured, follows Go best practices, includes proper error handling, and has all the core features implemented and working. The system can handle concurrent players, prevents exploitation through authentication, maintains data integrity, and includes comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities.

The project is ready for deployment and can serve as the backend for a resource-harvesting game. It includes a complete player authentication system, inventory management, and statistics tracking.
